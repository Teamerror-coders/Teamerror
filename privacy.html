    <p><h4>Journey Travel & Tours, is committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information that you provide to us
        when using the Journey Travel & Tours web site. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information
        received about you when you visit <www class="apnasafar"></www>.com. We may make content or services from other
        web sites
        including our co-branded web sites available to you from links located on https://www.apnasafar.com. These
        other web sites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each

    <h3>Privacy Policy Promise</h3>
    <p><h4>While information is the cornerstone of our ability to provide superior service, our most important asset is our
        clients’ trust. Keeping client information secure, and using it only as our clients would want us to, is a top
        priority for all of us at Journey Travel & Tours. Here then, is our promise to our individual customers:</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, any information our
            customers
            share with us.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>We will limit the collection and use of customer information to the minimum we require to deliver superior
            service to our customers, which includes advising our customers about our products, services and other
            opportunities, and to administer our business.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>We will permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, to
            have access to that information. Employees who violate our Privacy Promise will be subject to our normal
            disciplinary process.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>We will not reveal customer information to any external organization unless we have previously informed the
            customer in disclosures or agreements, or are required by law.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of our customer information. We may, however, share
            customer information with reputable companies when a customer has expressed an interest in their service or
            product. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to these other companys use of customer
            information.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to our
            privacy
            standards and to allow us to audit them for compliance.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>We will attempt to keep customer files complete, up-to-date, and accurate. We will tell our customers how
            and
            where to conveniently access their information (except when we’re prohibited by law) and how to notify us
            about
            errors which we will promptly correct.</h4></li>
